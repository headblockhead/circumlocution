Welcome to maker hell, where we have all the parts of a broken Ender 3 clone, none of the time, a copy of FreeCAD, and an unhinged desire to watch an overcomplicated 3D printer spin.

## Build Guide

You should not build this printer. That's probably not something you would usually read in a project's README, but it's true.

I designed this printer to make something out of the assorted scraps of parts and frame left over from a dissasembled Sovol SV01 (Ender 3 clone with direct drive), and ideally something that looked funny or cool, hence the spinning bed. 

99% of decisions were based on what I had, or what I could buy cheaply, so some part selections or fastener choices are very strange.

If you also have some random Ender 3 related printer parts around the place, this project might work for you, but I guarentee that you will need to change some elements of the design, and you are best off making something else with the parts.

## How? Why?

1. Around 50 hours of hard work
2. Because I thought it would be funny, and I wanted to join in with [hackclub's infill project](https://github.com/hackclub/infill).

I chose FreeCAD because:
  1. I hate it when people's projects require people to beg/borrow/steal/leagally-buy Autodesk Fusion 360 access just to see or modify them
  2. I wanted to become more familliar with how FreeCAD works.

I may revise/re-make this project into something more complete with a followable build guide and a better design (EG. lots of X-space could be saved on the extruder design, a longer alu. extrusion could add a second Z axis, etc.) someday.
